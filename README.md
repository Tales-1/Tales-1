# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Jawad Nazir and I am a Frontend Developer. This page showcases my open-source projects and contributions to the programming community. Feel free to browse and explore my work, and if you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

## About Me

Since November 2021, I have been immersing myself in the world of web development, where I have mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my journey has progressed, I have expanded my knowledge to include React, TypeScript, Redux, TailwindCSS, Python, and SQLite. I have been learning from various online platforms, such as freeCodeCamp, Scrimba, and HyperionDev, to ensure I get a diverse range of information. Through these efforts, I am confident in my ability to take on web development projects and excel in my future career.

## Featured Projects
[E-Commerce Website](https://github.com/Tales-1/e-shop-vite-build)

The aim of this website is to make a fake virtual store to put my learning to use. Having just learnt React and the fundamentals I saw this as a great opportunity test my comprehension of the React ecosystem.

I will also be learning & applying Tailwindcss, Redux and Typescript.js for the first time.

[Wordl Slang App](https://github.com/Tales-1/WordlSlangEdition)

This is a project I decided to code 2 months after learning JavaScript. It was quite tough but extremely rewarding at the same time given that I did not refer to any tutorials. It is one of my proudest accomplishments as, at the time, I was an amateur with no previous knowledge of building web applications.
